<h2>About</h2>
  This article aims at benchmarking 2 common machine learning libraries for a
few machine learning algorithms. The target of this study is multiclass
classification with sparse, not so sparse to dense datasets. We have explored
various dataset for this work with the cardinality of sample space ranging from
a few hundred to millions similarly for the cardinality of the feature space.
The algorithms studied are : 
<ul>
  <li>Logistic Regresion</li>
  <li>Softmax Regression</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
- Logistic Regression.
- Softmax Regression.
The Frameworks explored are:
- Mxnet
- Sci-Kit Learn.
These linear algorithms are optimized with different optimizers, we have chosen linear
classifiers because they have a fairly low training time. Mxnet which envisage to be a
faster solution for training deep neural network doesnâ€™t support conventional
optimization techniques rather it sticks to gradient descent and its variants popularly
found in the deep learning literature. Whereas libraries like sci-kit learn which envisage
to cater to the needs of machine learning in general supports various optimization
techniques. Faster optimization techniques gives sci-kit learn an advantage which
stochastic gradient descent fails to give to mxnet although implementation of mxnet
is much efficient.
