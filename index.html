<h2>About</h2>
  This article aims at benchmarking 2 common machine learning libraries for a
few machine learning algorithms. The target of this study is multiclass
classification with sparse, not so sparse to dense datasets. We have explored
various dataset for this work with the cardinality of sample space ranging from
a few hundred to millions similarly for the cardinality of the feature space. The algorithms studied are : 
* Logistic Regression.
* Softmax Regression.
